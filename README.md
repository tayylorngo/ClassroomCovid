# Classroom Covid - Hackhealth 2021 Project

## What it does
During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, many countries instituted lockdowns 
(general population restrictions, including orders to stay at home and work from home) 
to slow the rapid spread of the virus. Such measures have disrupted the normal functioning
of schools and universities and necessitated the delivery of alternative methods for students
and teachers to continue with their lessons. Our website is a platform where schools around 
the country can fill out a form detailing information on how they are still carrying on to 
provide education as the pandemic runs its course.

Researchers are allowed to take advantage of these novel teaching systems 
to learn more about various education techniques that may impact how future
generations will be learning even after the virus has cleared up. Families
with children looking to move on to higher education or just transferring 
schools can utilize our database to have a collective list in one place rather 
than finding this information individually, which can be a hassle. They can also 
compare and contrast issues that matter to them and have a
better understanding on specific school information.
